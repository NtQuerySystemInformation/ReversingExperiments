1.-Improve simple script (Fast structure rebuilding based on CPU word of target architecture).
	-Make it pass name and size of struct.
	-Apply in IDB (but not to specific ea, this is determined by the reverser.)

2.-Get stack strings from a certain range:
	-Pass ea address range <start/end> + register to get stack string.

3.-C++: RTTI mess arounds.
